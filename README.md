first robotics 2015 data logger

The datalogger project is an Arduino Galileo based system.  The purpose is to contatencate data from both local and remote sensors into a CSV file format and save it to a local SD card.  The data will be used to analize robot performance during competitions.  

Primary data includes system voltage, motor current, motor temperature, lift position, and game event data.

Data will be retrieved via SCP.
